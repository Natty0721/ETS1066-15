# Dictionary Methods: `get()`, `keys()`, and `values()`

# Introduction
Python dictionaries store data as **key-value pairs**, like a phone book! 

## 1.  `get(key)`
- Returns the value for a key if it exists.
- Returns `None` or a default if the key is missing.
- Prevents errors when key is not found.
- Well imagine you are looking for a student's grade in a record book. If the student isn't listed, instead of getting an error, you get a friendly message like "Not Found".

## 2. `keys()`
- Returns all the keys in the dictionary.
- It’s like flipping to the index of a notebook.
- Like flipping to the index of a book—you see all the topics (keys) without reading the full content.

## 3. `values()`
- Returns all the values stored in the dictionary.
- It’s like reading just the answers of a quiz.
- Think of this as reading the answers to all the test questions—without seeing the questions (keys)
